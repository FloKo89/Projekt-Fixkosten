# Project fixed costs

This small program is designed to give the user a quick and small overview of his fixed costs. 
In many cases, fixed costs already make up 50 percent of the monthly net salary - but it should not be more! It is more flexible and easier to live with 30 to 40 percent income reserved for fixed costs.

# Features 

* Sum of the monthly fixed costs
* Sum of the quarterly fixed costs
* Sum of the half-yearly fixed costs
* Sum of the yearly fixed costs
* Save and load function
* List of all fixed costs

# Motives

I wrote this program because I wanted to consolidate my basic knowledge in Python and in the module tkinter. Previously I have successfully completed the following courses from programmieren-starten.de:

* Python Master Course
* Python Tkinter Master Course
